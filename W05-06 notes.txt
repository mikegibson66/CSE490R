TDD - 

    TDD is a prctice of Agile, specifically XP
    Develop the test first, before start coding

    Unit Test --> Code --> Refactor --> repeat

  Steps:
    Based on Behavior Driven Design, testing for behavior first.
    Write a failing test for new feature first.
        -Test will fail because feature doesnt' exist.
    Refactor code to make good design
  Tests help make sure nothing was broken.

Test Driven                                    Behavior Driven
